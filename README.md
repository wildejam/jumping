# JUMPING!!! JUMPING ALL THE TIME!!!
## Jamison Wilder

__Interaction Description__
The tested interaction for this brief project will be jumping in a 3-dimensional VR space. There will be 3 versions of jumping implemented:
- The player presses a button on the handset. Once this button is pressed, the player performs a small jump in the virtual space
- The player presses and holds a trigger on the handset. While holding the trigger, a trajectory line appears in the virtual space indicating a jump trajectory. Once the trigger is released, a jump will be performed following that trajectory.
- The player presses a trigger to shoot out an explosive projectile. Upon shooting this projectile at their own feet, they will be propelled in the opposite direction according to the Unity physics engine.
